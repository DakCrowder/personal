          Lyon is known as the "gastronomic capital" of France, and wow it didn't disappoint.  I came to Lyon with the main
          goal to eat really well, and everything else was secondary.  However, I was charmed by the City and its sights
          and feel made it my favorite City I've been to so far.

          I'll begin by speaking about the City before I delve into rambling about all the great food I ate.  Lyon is a fairly large
          city with nearly 2 million in the area, but felt significantly smaller than Paris or London.  Nearly everything was walkable
          (if you don't mind hills) and quite beautiful.  The 'hustle and bustle' of larger cities was also absent in Lyon, and despite
          a good amount of tourists and locals wandering about it never felt overwhelming.  The city is split by 2 rivers, and has
          some hilly districts overlooking the city.

          Fourvière hill has two extremely interesting sights on its slopes - A white church you can see from nearly the whole city, and
          some ancient Roman ruins.  The inside of the church specifically was stunning, it had a darker feel than other Churches I've been
          in and also had some amazing murals on its walls.  The Roman Theatre ruins were also cool, as you could walk / climb over most of
          the old stones and also provided excellent views over the city.

          Now onto the cherry on top of my trip to Lyon, the wonderful cuisine.  My must try restaurant experience in Lyon was eating at a
          Bouchon, a traditional Lyonnais restaurant known for serving large portions and lots of meat (vegetarians are basically told to
          not even show up).  Bouchons also commonly have a semi-set menu, where you pay a set price for a full 3 course meal.  I selected a
          salad for my appetizer, but even that had enormous fatty cuts of bacon on it.  I ventured out for my entree and tried blood sausage
          for the first time.  The sausage was served over baked potatoes and apples.  Texture wise the sausage was
          pudding-like, and not the best to eat alone.  But when paired with the potatoes or especially the apples, it was actually quite good.
          The taste is difficult to describe, pretty meaty and tastes a bit like blood (duh) and has an aftertaste kind of like a well cooked
          steak or hearty meaty stew.  I'm not sure I would order blood sausage by itself again, but I'm glad I tried it and wouldn't shy away
          from a dish that has some in the future.  For dessert I had a chocolate pie.  When they brought it out, I was already so stuffed I
          was glad to see it didn't appear to be very large.  However, it was possibly the richest pie I've ever tasted, and by the time I finished
          I felt like I was about to burst.

          Another fabulous meal I had was from a tartine restaurant.  I had no idea what a tartine was, but for those who don't know
          its merely an open faced sandwich.  I ordered a mozzarrella, tomato, and pesto tartine that was excellent, but the star of the meal
          was my dessert.  The Raspberry tart had raspberry suspended in some kind of sweet clear glaze over a cheesecake-like base, and it was
          divine.  The best dessert of the trip so far.  Surprisingly the best entree I had in Lyon, wasn't French, but was Italian.  It was
          'Panijo', which is apparently Italian street food (although I ate in a decently nice place).  The Panijo was a kind of hamburger-esqe
          creation with mouth watering sausage and pesto between freshly wood-fired pizza dough.  It was served with griilled vegetables and
          Polenta fries, completed with the best pesto sauce I've ever had.

          The last foodie experience of note in Lyon was heading to a food hall named after famed chef Paul Bocuse.  The market is renowned
          for selling the absolutely best quality of any ingredient, but it felt overly sterile and corporate.  Seeing hundreds of cans of
          caviar and a truffle-specific was interesting, but I missed the crowd / noise / chaos that most other markets possess.

          In general, the people in Lyon were significantly more friendly than those in Paris.  I had excellent experiences at all the places
          I ate, and it all kinda felt like Home.  I would like to return on a better planned out journey and maybe try one of the many
          Michelin starred restaurants in the city, but alas that is for another day.
