          This post may seem... a bit out of order.  And it is.  Sometimes things fall into place, and I believe Mostar
          is the perfect medium to mull through some recent happenings.  This post will be in a somewhat different format,
          there is a story to be told rather than a simple mind dump I've been doing for most of the posts.  I quite enjoyed writing it,
          and think I should put more effort into the posts such that they may read in this manner.
          There are two main reasons for jumping Mostar ahead of some other locations I've been but have yet to post about.
          The first is how amazing Mostar is. The second concerns the recent passing of Anthony Bourdain.

          Mostar is a relatively small city nestled in a valley, wedged between mountains on all sides.  The city possesses a beautiful old town, which looks like it
          came straight out of a medieval movie.  A stunning bridge, the centerpiece and cultural symbol of the city, arches 60 feet
          above the river.  Locals commonly jump off the bridge (for money of course), along with some either stupid or brave tourists.
          I elected to forgo risk of serious injury and simply observe.  Describing Bosnian food is surprisingly easy.  It's MEAT.  A bunch of it.
          Minced meat, steak, chicken, sausages, veal, all grilled and all delicious.  Commonly served with a starch and some grilled veggies so you don't
          have to feel too bad about yourself. Bosnian food is about as straightforward as it gets, and serves as a beacon for meat lovers, a bastion
          safe from vegetarians.  Something that Anthony Bourdain would be sure to appreciate.

          Anthony Bourdain is undoubtedly one of the major reasons why I'm on this trip.  I've had this idea in my head
          for ~5 years or so that I wanted to "travel".  What the hell does that actually mean?  And what does it take?
          I now know that its as simple as getting on a plane and going somewhere.  Things tend to work themselves out.  But
          imagining what it might be like 1, 2, or 5 years ago was quite difficult.  Before leaving there was constant doubt
          that I was abandoning my career, something that I had spent what seems like the previous 10 or so years working
          to accomplish.

          Go to school.  Get good grades.  Go to college.  Get a career.  House, mortgage, kids - BAM - you're caught up in
          obligations until you're 50.  The standard Suburban White Kid Planâ„¢.  Watching Parts Unknown showed me the
          forbidden fruit, a world of delicious food, stunning places, and new cultural experiences.  A world where I might
          learn and experience the World at large rather than just my corner.  By day I might worry and stress over work,
          thinking that maybe I'd better put my head down and progress along my current path - travel was wasteful, would delay my climbing
          of the career ladder.  But some nights, watching Parts Unknown with a good beer, I knew that travelling was what I really
          wanted.  The show was always there to remind me, cajole me into doing something different.
          I don't mean to sound condescending towards those who might not travel - money and time are hard to come by.  One common opinion I've
          noticed among those who do travel is they think everybody should do it, and those who don't are wasting a valuable part of their lives.
          I think its easy to forget that for some people working and living a life of stability can be satisfying in a different way.
          And they might be far happier for it.

          Bourdain also showed me that its not about standing around looking at a building, snapping a few pics, and calling it a day.
          Learning about the local culture, not just the 1000 year old ruins (cool as they may be) but the recent developments.  Problems
          and how the place might overcome them.  And perhaps this is where Mostar comes into play.  A city torn apart by war only 23 years
          ago.  A city where Mosques outnumber churches, call for prayers broadcast over the city and 8:30 fireworks noting the end of fasting
          for Ramadan.  For the first time on the trip I felt out of place, a true minority.  It was wonderful.

          I learned A great deal of Mostar's recent history from a couple locals - a kindly gentleman who ran my Hostel named Taso, as well as
          a local tour guide.  Both people lived in Mostar through 2 sieges of the city from 1992 until 1994.  Much the city was destroyed,
          and bomb damage, bullet holes, and abandoned shelled out buildings are common sights today.  It really puts things into perspective
          when you hear that as a 7 year old Taso was living in a city without water, where there was a daytime curfew to prevent deaths from
          sniper fire, and living in basements became the norm as they were protected from shelling.

          The war in Bosnia has been over for over 20 years now, but the scars still remain.  And they run much deeper than the damaged
          buildings around town.  To give a bit of context, there are 3 main racial groups in Bosnia today - Serbs, Bosnians, and Croats.
          Before the war the population was largely intermixed, and marriages between Croats and Bosnians, Muslims and Christains were common.
          I was told that about 50% of all marriages were intermixed in some manner.  Today this is not the case.  Intermixed marriages are
          now uncommon, the Bosnian and Croats that make up the majority of the population in Mostar segregated among bounds set during the war.
          Croatia and Serbs bombed the city, with the Croatian military separating the Croats into the Western part of the city, relocating
          people of different ethnicities into the East.  These racial boundaries are still largely in place.  Even classrooms are somewhat
          segregated, Bosnains and Croatians separated into learning Bosnian and Croatian languages even though they are virtually
          identical.

          The people in Mostar are markedly serious, while also being warm and accepting.  I experienced this warmth firsthand while going
          to a Bosnian coffee house.  The place was small and cozy, with 3 total tables and a small bar for a few more people.  After being seated
          along with 2 others from my hostel, the owner sat down with us and explained to us the ritual that is drinking Bosnian coffee.  He
          stated the one word to describe the coffee was actually 'time'.  Bosnians take their time to drink the coffee, they use it as a time to drop
          worries or stress, a period to relax.  He displayed the correct method to drink the coffee, using water and a spoon to best eliminate
          the grounds sitting on the top of the small copper pot the coffee is served in.  Learning all of this really added to the experience,
          and I'll be damned if it wasn't one of the best coffees I've ever had.

          Going forward, Bosnia & Mostar have major problems to deal with.  The youth unemployment rate is a staggering 60%.  Brain drain is a real issue, as there
          are no jobs for educated youth.  The political system is an absolute mess - I won't explain too much about it,
          but the country has 3 presidents, and is divided into 2 areas with separate constitutions.  Perhaps the most worrying part is I was told
          it doesn't look like anything will change.  Corruption and bureaucracy halt progress.  Despite all of this, Mostar was one of my favorite
          destinations.  At times I think I've spent too much time this trip learning from placards and text, and too little time learning from people.
          In Mostar people will readily tell their story, all you have to do is listen.
